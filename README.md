I'm **Jeff**, self-taught web dev, self-proclaimed meme connoisseur. I'm always looking to learn and master the next exciting thing across many various disciplines. I love open-source technologies of all kinds, not just software. I firmly believe our collective human knowledge is paramount in propelling us into the awesome sci-fi future that my nerd heart desires. ❤️🤖

***TL;DR:*** I build cool stuff for the web and enjoy a bunch of different things.
