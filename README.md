I'm **Jeff**, self-taught web dev, self-proclaimed meme connoisseur. I'm always looking to learn and master the next cool thing across various disciplines. I love open-source technologies of any kind, not just software. I firmly believe our collective human knowledge is paramount in propelling us into the awesome sci-fi future that my nerd heart desires. ❤️🤖

TL;DR - I build cool stuff for the web and enjoy a bunch of different things.
